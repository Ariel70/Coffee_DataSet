## Introduction

In this analysis, I delved into a dataset containing sales information for various coffee types. The dataset comprised order details including order ID, order date, customer ID, product ID, quantity, customer name, email, country, coffee type, roast type, size, unit price, sales, coffee type name, roast type name, and loyalty card status.
The objective of this analysis was to clean the data, extract relevant information, and visualize the overall sales of different coffee types. By examining the sales performance of each coffee type, I aimed to gain insights into consumer preferences and trends.
This analysis provided valuable insights for coffee businesses to understand their market demand, optimize inventory management, and strategize marketing efforts effectively. Let's dive into the data-cleaning process and explore the sales patterns of various coffee types.
